### Summary

Several API's exist to serve up random or daily quotes. Most cost money, cannot be filtered by category, or simply contain too many bad quotes that no one wants to read.

This project aims simply to supply folks in need of quotes with good quotes that provide some sort of insight, or at least, humor. No more stupid 1980's movie quotes or cliches misattributed to Einstein.

Hopefully, this project meets your needs if your needs are for tasty, bite-sized bits of inspiration. Enjoy!
